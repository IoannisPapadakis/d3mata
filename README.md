# Mata D3 Library
Early work on writing Mata wrappers around D3js to provide access to creation of D3js data visualizations from Stata.


## Long Term
The initial goal is to develop the needed Mata Classes and methods to provide coverage for the D3js API.  The Mata libraries will then serve as the backbone for Stata wrappers for standardized data visualizations.
